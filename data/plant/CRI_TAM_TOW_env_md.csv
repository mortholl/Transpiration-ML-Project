NA,Above canopy,NA,Within canopy,Clearing,"Some measurements (net radiation and air temperature) had more than one sensor and placement within the canopy. The selected above are to capture the incident radiation above the overstory canopy and air temperature within the overstory canopy. Additionally, precip and VPD have different measurement timing (daily total and 30-min intervals, respecitvely). I have added to the end of the ""environmental_hd"" tab these data plus their respective timestamp. Rather than RH, we have vapor concentration at multiple heights, if needed. Only shallow SWC was provided since these parameter did not change within the first 20 cm and no other sensor was installed deeper than that. Please contact if any of these measurement placements should be altered or if there is any question regarding the precip and vpd data.
