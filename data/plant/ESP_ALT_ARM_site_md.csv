Units kg.h-1.cm-1 were transformed to kg.h-1 multiplying by the perimeter measured at the beginning of the year using dendrometer data. This approximation was used only for ARM data. For the other places the perimeter used was the one measured during sensor instalation. If more information is needed please ask. For 2014 data we used for calculating kg/h the perimeter from 2013.,TRUE,11.539147033715233,647.8553695965494,Woodland/Shrubland
