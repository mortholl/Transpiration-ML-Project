NULL,Clearing,leaf: midday,Not provided,Not provided,"A radiation shield-covered sensor on a central tower was installed beneath the canopy to measure both air temperature (Ta; in addition to Onset, Tidbit mounted on trees at 1.6 m) and relative humidity (RH; Onset, U23-002 Pro; ~2.5 m above the ground). Soil moisture was measured hourly with 5 sensors at 10 and 70 cm depth per site (Decagon, EC-5). Solar irradiance was measured using a micro-station and pyrometer position on an open field in the valley bottom (Onset, H21-002 Micro Station and S-LIB-M003 respectively).
