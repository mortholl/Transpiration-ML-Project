The orchard was 134 m by 172 m (2.3 ha) in extent. It was planted to ‘Cripps’ Pink’ (‘Pink Lady’) apples on M793 rootstock, with every 8th tree in each row being a ‘Hillary’ crab-apple pollinator. Row orientation was north – south and the trees were spaced at 1.25 m by 4 m, giving a planting density of 2000 stems per ha, with a short grass cover between rows. Average tree height was 5.1 m and average stem diameter at 0.3 m from the base of the tree was 0.1 m. Irrigation water and fertiliser (‘fertigation’) were applied by means of short-range micro-sprinklers, with scheduling based on daily soil moisture and weather data. The discharge rate of each micro-sprinkler was 30 L.h¯¹, equivalent to 5 mm per hour for emitters which were positioned every 1.5 m within the tree rows. Soils were gravel, with a high sand and stone content, well drained and with an effective rooting depth of approximately 0.6 m. Annual orchard yields were 54 t.ha¯¹ in the 2008/2009 season and 69 t.ha¯¹ in the 2009/2010 season, with an average of 61.5 t.ha¯¹ over the two seasons.",TRUE,12.6720338438864,637.8946772174824,Woodland/Shrubland
