# This file creates classes of locations sorted into sets related by either climate statistics or plant functional type

# Step 1: Compile all sites into a csv with location name, MAP, MAT, average wind speed, and plant functional type


# Step 2: Implement K-means to come up with clusters of similar climate statistics, store file names in class lists


# Step 3: Split sites into 2 groups by functional types, store file names in class lists
