# File for analyzing the correlation between each environmental variable and the PM prediction and measurement
# Plot variables against prediction/measurement for selected sites
# Statistical analysis using linear regression to predict how well each variable correlates with transpiration
# Normalize correlation to come up with prediction of feature importance for the measured transpiration values
